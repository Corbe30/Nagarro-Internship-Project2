# Corbe's Comic Books

This is the final project at Nagarro Summer Internship. It is an e-commerce website made with HTML, CSS, Javascript, EJS, Express, Node.js and Stripe. Features included are:
✅ Show products page
✅ Add to Cart feature
✅ Working payment option with Stripe

The Stripe public and private key were hidden by declaring those environment variables in Heroku itself.
